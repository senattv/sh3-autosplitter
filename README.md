# How to use it

 * Download the `sena-autosplitter.asl` file
 * On LiveSplit, right click, select `Edit Splits`
 * Click the `Settings` option in the top right corner of the window that opens
 * In the `Script Path` field, navigate to the `sena-autosplitter.asl` file, wherever you downloaded it
 * Activate the options for `start`, `split` and `reset`
 
When you play the game, the splitter should start every time you start New Game/Extra
New Game/Load Ganme/Continue, and there should be a split every time you transition
between doors. It is up to you to set up how many splits you need depending on your
category/route.
