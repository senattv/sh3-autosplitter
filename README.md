# How to use it

 * Download the `sena-autosplitter.asl` file
 * On LiveSplit, right click, select `Edit Layout`
 * Click the `+` icon > `Control` > `Scriptable Auto Splitter`
 * Under `Script Path`, navigate to the `sena-autosplitter.asl` you just downloaded
 * Activate the options for `start`, `split` and `reset`
 * Optionally, if you are running 10-Star, check the "10 Stars" option under `Advanced` to ignore rooms you need to revisit several times.
 
When you play the game, the splitter should start every time you start New Game/Extra
New Game/Load Game/Continue, and there should be a split every time you transition
between doors. It is up to you to set up how many splits you need depending on your
category/route.
